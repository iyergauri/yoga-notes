# The Knee

## muscles
* muscles heal much faster than ligaments

## structural variation
* you can't fix bone structure but you should still teach good alignment
  * bow legs: press down through inner foot
  * knocked knees: can spread feet in tadasana, press down through outer foot
* hyperextension is a 'structural/functional variation' bc you can lessen it by microbending
  * for when people feel their knees are 'beyond straight' and 'locked in place'
