# Hips
* these guys are bendy in all the directions, which is why

## neutral rotation 
* cues should uh, be easier here
* hip points should all be sagittally, coronally, and transversially (?) neutral
* hinging front = anterior pelvic tilt = hip bowl of water spilling forwards
* hinging back = posterior pelvic tilt = hip bowl of water spilling backwards 

## external rotation (e.g. warrior 2)
* need to rotate knee to go straight toward front of mat
* frontal hip bones slightly turn in the transverse plane (not all the way to either side)
  * if you try to face them the same way as your chest, your knee alignment will be off
