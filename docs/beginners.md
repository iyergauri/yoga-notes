# verbiage
* avoid sanskrit
* explain what blocks, straps, bolsters are
* use body parts before mentioning pose names

## modify upwards
* start with absolute easy (too easy) modifications and build 'rewards'
  * they won't feel disappointed for trying out the psychological extra credit

# sequencing
* no chaturanga, no urdha mukha svanasana (all the way down)
* guide each leg up-and-back through sun salutes
* the only balance pose applicable is tree; no arm balances

## modifications
* half-moon, vira3 can be at the wall
* standing poses: feet don't need to be too wide
* toes can splay instead of being parallel
* instead of clasping hands, use strap
* elbows can splay out a little 
* knee issues can cause difficulty bending knee (same w/ shoulder, elbow)
* you can keep toes curled under for any lunge position / UMS 

### back-pain specific
* it's hard to relieve back pain without increasing blood pressure (like fwd fold); backs are tricky
* reduce stress is a way to relieve back pain: soften face, focus on breathing
