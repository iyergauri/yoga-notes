# verbiage
* avoid sanskrit
* explain what blocks, straps, bolsters are
* use body parts before mentioning pose names

## modify upwards
* start with absolute easy (too easy) modifications and build 'rewards'
  * they won't feel disappointed for trying out the psychological extra credit

# sequencing
* no chaturanga, no urdha mukha svanasana (all the way down)
* guide each leg up-and-back through sun salutes
* the only balance pose applicable is tree; no arm balances
