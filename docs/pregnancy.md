* keep mom-to-be's safe in their body
* to help strengthen the body, prepare for birth, and recover afterwards
* safe for women who haven't practiced yoga before (but with prenatal instructors)

## poses
* focus on stabilizing, avoid deep stretches
  * activate muscles (such as in forward folds) to release pressure
* positioning of the baby can be changed a little during beginning of third trimester
  * maintain neutral pelvis, which is a little anterior tilt (DON'T tuck the tailbone under

## cardiovascular system
* 50% more fluid increases heart rate and pressure => breathlessness
* vinyasa lvl 2/3 might not be appropriate

## contraindications 
* no standing postures or lying-on-back held for super long (5-8 breaths max)
* no uterus compression
  * no belly-down lying down after 24wks
  * roll to left side instead of right as a transition
  * no backbends or deep twists; this puts too much compression on uterus
  * no crunches (for ab work, do plank stuff) 
* no advanced inversions, pranayama, and hot yoga :(

## changes to the body
* super wide legs could cause discomfort, so bring the legs in a lil 
* deep forward bends / hip openers could make the si joint hurt
* softened muscles => more flexibility, so engage muscles to increase stability rather than folding in 
* balancing can mess w center of gravity lol so do stuff at the wall
* belly literally in the way? don't fold all the way over, and go plank --> AMS

this is true for most women. but we are not doctors. and 
# women have agency of their own body.
