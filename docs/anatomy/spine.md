# the spine
* from top to bottom: cervical (neck), thoracic (upper back), lumbar (lower back), and sacrococcygeal regions
* have 7, 12, 5 vertebrae, and tailbone (1) respectively

## anatomy
* lordotic: towards the front of the body (cervical and lumbar)
* kyphotic: towards the back of the body (thoracic)

## movements
* saggital: so nice to meet you! (moving forward and back)
* coronal: splaying side-to-side (like a crown)
* transverse: twist (alliteration)

## stabilization
* working the core against other movements 
* core stabilization happens at 

# muscles
* rectus abdominus = 6pack
  * helps round the spine in shapes like cat pose, and holds spine to prevent unwanted bends (like in camel)
* obliques
  * we have external & internal
  * helps: rotation (of the trunk), flexion (bending front and back), and lateral flexion (bending sideways)
* transverse abdominus
  * like a corset that wraps from the back to the front of the body
  * keeps upright
  * contracts when forced exhale/puking lol
* erector spinnae are muscles by spine.
  * subtle backbend / 'straight back' in halfway lift / avoiding a round
* QL: where people injure themselves lol (from functional movements)
* multifidi
